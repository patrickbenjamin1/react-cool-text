# react-cool-text

A cool text component for making your interwebzone look real stylish my dude.

# Playground

This playground is a useful place to dev `react-cool-text`

To run the playground, run `npm run start-playground` from the root to build, watch and serve it through webpack to `localhost:8000`

I may expand this out with a ui to edit the various props, and deploy it somewhere.
